            I'm a Computer Science graduate from the Open University of Israel,
            passionate about web development and problem-solving. Proficient in
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I have hands-on experience
            building responsive web applications. Iâ€™m a quick learner, eager to
            contribute and grow as a front-end developer, delivering
            high-quality results in a collaborative team environment.
